## Homebrew

Homebrew installs the stuff you need that Apple didn’t. See more in [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

- To install Homebrew paste that in a macOS Terminal or Linux shell prompt.

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh>)"
```

### Homebrew formulae

Everything I install with Homebrew

```sh
brew install ruby

## Ruby Packages

I don't program in Ruby, but I do use some ruby apps.

```sh
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

## Text editor

I miss `notepad.exe` Windows simple and fast default text editor, "Leafpad" may be better for that but the website would not even load. also the MacOs `textEdit.app` is one of the worst text editor app I have ever used when it comes to UX.
